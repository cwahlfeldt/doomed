  Destiny 2 has had a rough year. The hype train was real when the game came
  out, as it was slated to reinvigorate the IP (Destiny) to surpass its almost
  beta-like first entry in the game series.

I was one of the millions of gamers that bought the game on day one for PS4. The new story and multitude of activities to complete kept me occupied for only long, and after completing the story and maxing out my character the game became too monotonous and downright boring!

If this describes your experience with the game, you are not alone. That being said, I still think the developers have the potential to turn it around. Maybe Bungie (“Bungo” as Reddit would call them) can restore _Destiny 2_ in similar fashion to Square Enix’s _Final Fantasy XIV_, who seemingly recreated an entire game after a horrible launch. They could also take notes from their last game, _Destiny_, and revamp it the same way that “The Taken King” expansion did.

Whatever they end up doing to the game, it still doesn’t fix the fact that fans are currently complaining incessantly about not being able to scratch their multiplayer itch that other games do. Remember kids, there are thousands of games you can play that are not _Destiny 2_!

## Battlerite

The term MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) get thrown around a lot, and in and of itself is a generic term that accurately describes one of my favorite games of the last year, _Battlerite_. The game quickly took my attention away from _Destiny 2_, and has held on to it ever since. It’s a really fun game that focuses on fast-paced, action-packed, skill-shot driven gameplay that somewhat mimics _League of Legends_ and _Dawn of the Ancients_ but with finer tuned controls. The games within _Battlerite_ only last up to 10 minutes, so it’s perfect for anyone that has other things to do.

## PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds

What the fuck is up with this game! _PUBG _(PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) took the gaming world by storm this last year, as the game is a battle royale shooter that pits 100 players against each other on a massive map. Players must find weapons, armor, energy drinks, and other necessities in order to survive. It’s ridiculous and amazingly deep, and I was very surprised by how much fun this game was. I was expecting to be pissed after my first match, and I felt doomed when I jumped out of a plane, but what I actually experienced was pure, unadulterated, fucking bliss. The sheer scope of the map and the amount of adrenaline with every step your character takes really speaks to why this game was so successful in 2017.

## Fortnite

I can’t talk about _PUBG_ without bringing up its competitor, Fortnite. I actually played this game before I played _PUBG_. This game is a more approachable and free version of the battle royale shooter genre that _PUBG_ made famous earlier in 2017. Unlike its competitor, Fortnite is actually a building and survival game where you construct forts with friends and survive zombie outbreaks. If you’re a fan of Minecraft and also think _PUBG_ is for trolls, then this game is for you!

## Witcher 3

Holy shit! This game came out three years ago! It’s regarded as one of the best western style RPG’s of this decade, if not of all time. I can mostly agree. I’m not much of a proponent of story driven games, and the older I get the more I just want the satisfaction of gains and sweet, sweet loot (if that makes any sense). However, _Witcher 3_ has drawn me in and made me a true believer of well-written stories with games. There are times in the game when I wish I could just do all the story parts without suffering the more monotonous tasks of the game, such as running to different towns. With that said, this game is a beauty to behold and has some of the best graphics I’ve seen on any game, three years old or not! 

## Honerable Mention: Arena of Valor

Arena of Valor copies off _League of Legends’_ design and aesthetics. There, I said it!  I’m surprised more people don’t just come out and fucking say it. _Arena of Valor_, developed by Tencent Games, is the largest and most popular game in the world right now. It was just released in the US and is gaining momentum.  It is a striped-down version of _League of Legends_. The game is approachable, but still suffers from the same toxic community that _League_ has. Keep an eye on this one if you like MOBAs and companies that copy other games!
