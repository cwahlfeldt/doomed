Destiny 2 has had a rough year. The hype train was real when this came out, and was slated to reinvigorate the IP (Destiny) to surpass its almost “beta” like first entry.

I was one of the millions of gamer’s that bought the game day one for PS4. The new story and multitude of activities to complete would keep me at bay for only so long. After completed the story and maxing my character out the game became monotonous and downright boring!

If this describes your experience with the game then you are not alone. With all that being said I still think the developers have potential to turn it around. Maybe Bungie “bungo” (as reddit would call them) can restore Destiny 2 in similar fashion to Square-Enix’s FFXIV, which seemingly recreated an entire game. They could also take notes from there last game Destiny 1, and revamp it the same way the expansion “The Taken King” did.

Whatever they end doing to the game it still doesn’t fix it for the meantime which leads fan’s to either complain incessantly or simply scratch that multiplayer itch with other games. Remember kids there are thousands of games you can play that are not Destiny 2!

## Battlerite

The term MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) gets thrown around alot, and in and of itself is a generic term but accurately describes one of my favorite games of this last year, Battlerite. It quickly took my attention away from destiny and has held on to it since. Its a really fun game that focuses on fast paced, action packed, skill shot driven gameplay that somewhat mimics League and Dota but with finer tuned controls. The games only last up to 10 min so its perfect for anyone that has other things to do.

## PUBG

What the fuck is up with this game!!! Took the gaming world by storm this last year! Player Unknowns Battlegrounds is a battle royale shooter that pits 100 people against eachother on a huge map. Players must find weapons, armor, energy drinks, etc to survive. Its rediculous and amazingly deep. I was very suprised by how much fun this game was. I was expeciting to be pissed after my first match, and felt doomed when I jumped out of that plane but what I actually experienced was pure unadulterated fucking bliss. The sheer scope of the map and the amount of adrenaline with every step your charatcer takes really speaks to why this game was so succesful in 2017.

## Fortnite

I cant talk about PUBG without bringing up its competitor, Fortnite. I actually played this game before I played PUBG. This game is a more apporachable and free version of the battle royale shooter genre that PUBG made famous in earlier 2017. Unlike its competitor, fortnite is actually a building/survival game where you build forts with friends and survive zombie outbreaks. If your a fan of minecraft and also think PUBG is for trolls than this game is for you!

## Witcher 3

Holy shit this game came out 3 years ago. Its regarded as one of the best western style RPG’s of this decade, if not all time. I can mostly agree. I’m not much a proponent to story driven games. The older I get the more I just want the satifaction of gains and sweet sweet loot (if that makes any sense). However the witcher 3 has drawn me in and made me a true believer of well written story games. There are times in the game when I wish i could just do all the story parts and that some of the more mkonotous tasks like running to a different town, could be just go away. With that said this game is a beauty to behold and has some of the best graphics I’ve seen on any game, 3 years old or not!

## honerable mention Arena of Valor

Arena of Valor copies off league of legends design and asthestics. There I said it! I’m suprised more people dont just come out and fucking say it. Arena of Valor, developed by Tencent Games is the largest and most popular game in the world right now. It was just realeased in the US and is gaining speed. Its a striped down version league of legends. Its approachable but still suffers from the same toxic community that league has. keep an eye on this one.
